## Dumping csv files based on a timeframe:
- Before testing establish connection to you local DB by changing db name and user name in config.ini file.
- To get the csv dump run the following command:
python3 csv_dump.py --active_timestamp [start_date] [end_date]
eg: python3 csv_dump.py --active_timestamp 2019-01-30 2019-01-31
- You should see the data dump in moc-reporting_csv_dump folder under the timestamp folder when it was run.
